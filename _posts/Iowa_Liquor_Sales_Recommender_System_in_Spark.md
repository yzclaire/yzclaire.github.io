### [Iowa Liquor Sales Recommender System in Spark](https://yzclaire.github.io/Iowa_liquor_sales_recommender_systems_in_spark/)

In the retail space, profit margin is usually low. So we are playing the game of volumn. The more sales generated, the more likely to make a profit.  One of the startegies is find cross-selling opportunity from current clients.

At this project, I built recommender systems for Iowa liquor wholesalers to see if we can recommend new products to liquor stores.
